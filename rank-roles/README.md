# Rank Roles Plugin

## Installation
```
?plugin add scragly/modmail-plugins/rank-roles@main
```

> Specifying `@main` is required as modmail expects `master` branch to be the default

## Commands

### `?level`
Show recipient's level.  

Stats are from the main server even if modmail threads are in a secondary server.  

You can add a message to include with the `set_level_msg` command, with support for
the same variables as `freply`.
